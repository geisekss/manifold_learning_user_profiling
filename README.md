# Manifold Learning for user profiling based on motion sensor data


A novel user-agnostic approach for identity verification based on motion traits acquired by mobile sensors. The proposed approach does not require user-specific training before deployment in mobile devices nor does it require any extra sensor in the device. This solution is capable of learning a user profiling manifold from a small user subset and extend it to unknown users. We validated the proposal on two public datasets. The reported experiments demonstrate remarkable results under a cross-dataset protocol and an open-set setup. This repository is part of the published paper "Manifold learning for user profiling and identity verification using motion sensors" (PII S0031-3203(20)30211-9).
